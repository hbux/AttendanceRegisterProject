## Introduction and Task
In this assessment you will design and build a Web application that makes use of modern application development frameworks and development techniques. You will demonstrate your understanding of the design techniques, architectures and technical opportunities provided by such frameworks. 
You will be working on teams of 3 to 5. Details about confirming your team composition will be circulated separately on the Blackboard site and during classes.

This application should be built to meet the needs of the clients in the case study presented in a separate document. The case study has been selected as it offers several challenges with regards to design, usability, security, and privacy. Your design should reflect these issues; we expect designs and implementations that deal with each of these key challenges.  This assessment will require a coordinated approach and as such, we expect you to plan your time appropriately using an appropriate project management model. 

Your design should consider the case study holistically. For implementation, you can select two or three major functionalities within your group. The selected functionalities should include at least two types of users.
